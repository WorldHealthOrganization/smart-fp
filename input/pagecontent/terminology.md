### Terminology defined as part of the WHO Family Planning Guideline Implementation Guide

<p style="background-color: gold; border:1px solid maroon; padding: 5px; max-width: 790px;">Note that the terminologies included in this implementation guide will need to be updated, because the ideal mechanism for distribution (as an expression) is not currently supported by the content logical definition constructs available in the FHIR ValueSet resource and all known implementations of it. Before use in a production environment, ensure you have the latest value sets based on the definitions for each value set (as defined in the inclusion/exclusion criteria for each one).</p>

The following terminology artifacts have been defined for the Family Planning Guidelines implementation guide:

#### CodeSystems

#### ValueSets
