#### Iron and Folic Acid Supplementation

##### Recommendation A2.1
Daily oral iron and folic acid supplementation with 30 mg
to 60 mg of elemental iron2 and 400 μg (0.4 mg) of folic acid3 is
recommended for pregnant women to prevent maternal anaemia,
puerperal sepsis, low birth weight, and preterm birth.

##### Recommendation A2.2
Intermittent oral iron and folic acid supplementation with 120 mg
of elemental iron5 and 2800 μg (2.8 mg) of folic acid once weekly is
recommended for pregnant women to improve maternal and neonatal
outcomes if daily iron is not acceptable due to side-effects, and in
populations with an anaemia prevalence among pregnant women of
less than 20%.
